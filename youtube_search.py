youtube_search.py

Library module for searching YouTube videos with no views.

The Google YouTube Data API comes with certain restrictions that prevents
from directly searching for content with no views. Namely:
  1) view count cannot be used as a search parameter, and
  2) any search query will return at most 500 results.

This script uses a brute force type approach by performing the search to a
number of search terms and keeps track of the results with zero views.

The search terms are read from a text file containing common English language
words. To prevent the same search term from returning the same results, a random timeframe
is generated for each API query.
